This project showcases my understanding of vanilla Javascript to create a Pagination form without the use of plug-ins.

### Build status
Done with basics. Going to add exceeds feature with search bar capability soon.

### Start Date:

### End Date (non permanent):
8/28/20

### Code style

### Features
No matter how many students are added to the pagination, the webpage will sort them by 10.

### Credits
The team at Treehouse are superstars each step of the way. Thank you!
